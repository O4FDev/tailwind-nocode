## Technology Overview

The entire site gets created in Next.js, TailwindCSS, and HeadlessUI. In the future, I would add Clerk, MongoDB (for long-term CMS management), and REST through serverless. 

## Deployment 
You will need to sign up for the following services:

- Vercel

Firstly, you should clone the repo and install the dependencies using the command `cd tailwind-nocode && npm install`.

You will run the repo locally using `npm run dev`

You could then deploy through Vercel (as of 17/FEB/2022) with a few basic steps.
